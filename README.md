# GfW Comments Web Monetization Service

This project is openDemocracy's Grant for Web-funded project to bring novel incentives to commenting via web monetization of the [Coral Talk](https://github.com/coralproject/talk) open-source comments platform.

## Staging server

You can interact with the prototype by visiting:

https://comment-service.staging-caprover.opendemocracy.net/articles/some-article/

Where 'some-article' is a URL slug for an imaginary article on openDemocracy. Changing the slug will generate a new article.

The article's author can highlight comments in Coral if their Coral user ID is included in the article page template as e.g. `<meta name="author_comment_id" content="89a0e9a2-32b1-468a-a101-7005b4cf62e3" />`. This is done through the CMS and can be mocked in this imaginary article by adding the Coral user id as a URL parameter to the above URL `?caid=89a0e9a2-32b1-468a-a101-7005b4cf62e3`. Coral user IDs can be found in the Coral admin dashboard.

## Communication from Coral Talk instance

This project is running at http://opendemocracy.net/newcommenteconomics

A staging Coral Talk instance is running at https://coral-talk.staging-caprover.opendemocracy.net. 

### Webhook Events

This has been set to trigger the endpoint:

`/create-story`

whenever the "STORY_CREATED" event fires in Coral Talk. This happens every time the Coral Talk widget loads on a new page, so the event is fired every time you visit a variation on the URL above. `server.js` provides the endpoint and creates JSON files in `/public` for that story (using the URL slug as identifier).

### Moderation phase

Every comment posted to Coral is sent to [./server.js](./server.js) via a "Moderation phase" in the Coral Talk instance. This hits the `/handle-comment` endpoint.

The service reads these comments and looks for identifiers sent in the comment body that it is being passed an author's web monetization wallet address, or a comment to highlight on the page. Comments that are used to pass messages are moderated as `status: 'REJECTED'` meaning they aren't shown as comments.

## Client-side JavaScript

Finally, this project provides a client side script for the page to embed which displays an interactive widget that guides commenters and page authors through their user journeys.

This file is stored in `views/client.js` and is served via the Nunjucks templating engine so we can insert the correct URL for it to look for the JSON files generated by the above endpoints.

## Running locally

Following the steps below will ensure you get your local version up and running as quickly as possible. 

### Supporting software: download and update / install

Firstly, and if you haven't already, install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) for your OS. If you have Docker, make sure it's up-to-date. Install NodeJS if you haven't already.

### Coral Talk Step 1: clone and install dependencies

Secondly, clone openDemocracy's forked Coral Talk:

`$ git clone git@github.com:openDemocracy-org/talk.git`

We need a Coral Talk instance for the service to interact with. openDemocracy's [forked version](https://github.com/openDemocracy-org/talk) requests a JS file from this service [./views/iframe.js](./views/iframe.js), allowing us to run custom JS within the Coral Talk iframe. That's the only difference.

On the `main` branch of your cloned `talk`, run `$ npm install`

### Coral Talk Step 2: download docker database images

We are following the instructions for running Coral Talk from source on [Coral's setup page](https://docs.coralproject.net/coral/#source):

Setup Mongo and Redis using Docker:

```
$ docker run -d -p 27017:27017 --restart always --name mongo mongo:4.2
$ docker run -d -p 6379:6379 --restart always --name redis redis:3.2
```

### Incentives Service: clone, install dependencies and run

Clone this project and `npm install`. Copy `.env.default` to `.env`. 

Run `npm run watch:fake-site` to start the fake site.

You should now be able to access the development oD website at [http://localhost:2000/articles/hello-world](http://localhost:2000/articles/hello-world]).

In a new terminal window, run `npm run watch:service`

### Coral Talk Step 3: run and install a local Coral Talk instance

Our forked Coral Talk requests a JS file from this service. We need it to load our local version for local development. Open `src/core/server/app/views/templates/base.html` and comment out the staging URL and add the local URL:

`<script src="https://localhost:4000/assets/iframe.js"></script>`

Coral's setup docs say you can just start the service now, but we've only had success running the build command first:

`$ npm run build:development`

Once this has completed you can run

`$ npm run start:development`

You should now be able to access the Coral Talk install page at [http://localhost:3000/install](http://localhost:3000/install). 

### Connecting them up

Follow the Coral Talk installation steps. The only value that matters is the Site Permitted Domains. This needs to be set to the URL of our fake site above: http://localhost:2000

Once install is complete, you should be able to see the Coral comments panel at the bottom of an article page: [http://localhost:2000/articles/hello-world](http://localhost:2000/articles/hello-world])

(If this hasn't worked, check the ports are 4000 for the Incentives Service and 3000 for Coral Talk. Make sure you have copied .env.default to .env in the code for this project.)

Within your Coral Talk instance you need to create an External Moderation phase, an endpoint where all the comments get sent to. Our handler in [./server.js](./server.js) is listening on `/handle-comment` so the URL should be http://localhost:4000/handle-comment.
