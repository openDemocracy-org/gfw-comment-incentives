# Changes required to Coral Talk

Currently the only change is the addition of a script tag at the bottom of their base template:

`src\core\server\app\views\templates\base.html`
`++ <script src="[env.SERVICE_ROOT_URL]/assets/iframe.js"></script>`

Where assets/iframe.js is served from views/iframe.js by server.js.

## Coral Talk technical approach

Define a new PostMessageService handler

handler would be JS code similar to that inside iframe.js.

Alternatively, we persuade Coral Team to allow arbitrary functions to be passed in by verified / trusted external services. This would ensure our contribution to core would be usable by others for alternative ends.
